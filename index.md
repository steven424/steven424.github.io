        <h3 class="title-places">The small but beautiful country positioned right in the middle of the Balkan Region. </h3>

        <p>Closed to outsiders for much of the 20th century, Albania has long been Mediterranean Europe's enigma. Until fairly recently its rumpled mountains, <em>fortress towns</em> and <em>sparkling beaches</em> were merely a rumour on most travel maps. But, with the end of a particularly brutal strain of communism in 1991, Albania tentatively <strong>swung open</strong> its gates.<br> <br>The first curious tourists to arrive discovered a land where ancient codes of conduct still held sway and where the wind whistled through the shattered remnants of half-forgotten ancient Greek and Roman sites. A quarter of a century after throwing off the shackles of communism, Albania's <em>stunning mountain scenery</em>, <em>crumbling castles</em>, <em>boisterous capital</em> and <em>dreamy beaches</em> rivalling any in the <strong><em>Mediterranean</em></strong> continue to enchant. But hurry here, because as word gets out about what Albania is hiding, the still-tiny trickle of tourists threatens to become a <strong>flood</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="title-places">Albanian Beaches</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Gjipe_beach%2C_Albania.JPG" width="450" alt="Beautiful Albanian Beach">
        <p>Albania’s rugged coastline, with traditional villages nestled in isolated bays and golden beaches lapped by turquoise waters, was a revelation when travellers first started discovering the country during the turn of the century. Since then Europe’s last untouched beaches have changed almost beyond recognition, but there’s still plenty of reason to come here and explore this magnificent coastline where the <em>Adriatic</em> and <em>Ionian</em> seas meet.<br> <br> You may have heard of the <em>Albanian Riviera</em> and its beaches, once catchwords of true backpackerdom – their names were synonymous with unspoilt sands backed by rolling hills covered in olive groves, rustic accommodation right next to the water, and grilled meats and cold beers for the equivalent of a handful of change. <br> <br> Inevitably that hasn’t endured; asphalt roads now connect all but the most far-flung of the Riviera’s villages, while hotels, restaurants and holiday homes dot the coastline. Today you’re more likely to be competing for beach space with a day-tripping family from Tirana than a crowd of international shoestringers. And yet, despite the Riviera’s transformation, there are still idyllic and breathtaking spots along this craggy coast. </p>

        <h3 class="title-places">Albanian Mountains</h3>
        <p>The flagship region for mountain tourism is the <strong><em>Albanian Alps</em></strong>, the <em>National Parks of Thethi</em>, <em>Valbona</em> and the <em>Region of Kelmendi</em>. The <strong><em>“Accursed Mountains”</em></strong> are both truly spectacular and virtually impenetrable except for a series of high passes that link the small number of farmsteads and homes in the valleys below to the outside world during the summer months.</p> 
        <br>
        <h4 class="title-mountains">The National Park of Thethi</h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Theth_Radohima_MajaArapit.jpg" width="450" alt="Beautiful View of Theth Naticonal Park">
        <p>Located 70 km from <em>Shkodra</em>, you must pass <em>Qafa e Tërthores</em> at 2,000 m before descending to <em>Gropa e Thethit</em> by crossing a stream bearing the same name. It is a journey you’ll want to have your camera ready for, full of extended mountain views, with water cascading down craggy hillsides and trees reaching for sunlight on rocky slopes. The area is rich in sights such as the waterfall of <em>Grunas</em>, 30 m high, the amazing cold-water sources of <em>Okol</em>, and the caves of <em>Birrat me Rrathë</em> (Round Holes) and <em>Mount Arapi</em>.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="title-mountains">Valbona Mountains</h4>
        <p>Valbona is located 25km away from the city of <em>Bajram Curri</em> and is the most important inhabited center of the valley. It is full of traditional houses that create a picturesque view in symmetry with the natural wonders of the valley, which widens again at this point. In Valbona, there is a comfortable and traditional hotel, or you may have the opportunity to stay at a village home, as the inhabitants’ generosity and hospitality are well known. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The area is also known for its characteristic regional cooking, with specialties such as <strong>mazja</strong>, <strong>flija</strong> (a many layered pancake-like dish cooked outdoors over open coals and steamed, often served with local honey), and <strong>pitja</strong>. Beyond <em>Selimaj</em>, the road continues through the valley with breathtaking vistas with rich colors of both spring life and of the snow that covers the nearby craggy peaks.</p>
